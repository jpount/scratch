# Coding Standards and Best Practices

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for this repository. All pull requests will be reviewed against these standards.

## General Principles

1. **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting with clear variable and function names
2. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
3. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones
4. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication

## Code Style

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable names (avoid single letters except for loop counters)
- Functions should do one thing and do it well
- Maximum function length: 50 lines (prefer smaller)
- Use async/await over callbacks for asynchronous code

### Comments
- Write comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc for function documentation
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Avoid obvious comments (e.g., `// increment i` for `i++`)

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors appropriately
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Never swallow errors silently

## Security Best Practices

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Authentication**: Use proper authentication mechanisms
3. **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
4. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up-to-date and review security advisories

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Tests should be readable and maintainable
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Git Commit Messages

- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Provide detailed description in the body if needed

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid N+1 queries in database operations
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Profile and optimize critical paths

## Documentation

- Update README.md when adding new features
- Document API endpoints with request/response examples
- Include setup instructions for new dependencies
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
